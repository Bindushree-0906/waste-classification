# waste-classification


This project aims to develop an intelligent waste classification system using IoT (Internet of Things) technology. The system utilizes a camera to capture images of waste materials, which are then processed and classified using a deep learning model. Based on the classification results, the system controls LED bulbs to indicate the category of the waste as biodegradable, non-biodegradable, or e-waste. The core hardware components required for this project include a Raspberry Pi, a web camera, LEDs, jumper cables, a breadboard, and LAN cables.

Installation and Setup
To set up the intelligent waste classification system, follow the steps outlined below:

Hardware Setup
Connect the Raspberry Pi to a power source and ensure it is running properly.
Attach the web camera to the Raspberry Pi using the appropriate USB port.
Connect the LEDs to the Raspberry Pi using the jumper cables and breadboard. Assign GPIO pins for each LED and connect them accordingly.
Ensure the LAN cables are connected to the Raspberry Pi to enable communication with the system.
Software Installation
Install the required operating system (e.g., Raspbian) on the Raspberry Pi following the official documentation.
Set up the necessary dependencies on the Raspberry Pi, including Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, and other libraries required for image processing and deep learning tasks.
Clone or download the intelligent waste classification project repository from the provided source.
Configuration
Configure the web camera on the Raspberry Pi and ensure it is working correctly.
Adjust the GPIO pin assignments in the project code according to the connections made with the LEDs.
Customize the settings of the deep learning model if required, such as training or fine-tuning on specific waste classification data.
Usage
To utilize the intelligent waste classification system, perform the following steps:

Power on the Raspberry Pi and ensure all hardware connections are properly set up.
Navigate to the project directory on the Raspberry Pi using the command line interface.
Execute the main script that initiates the waste classification system.
The camera will start capturing images of waste materials automatically.
The captured images will be sent to the deep learning classification unit for processing.
Based on the classification results, the corresponding LED bulb will illuminate to indicate the waste category (biodegradable, non-biodegradable, or e-waste).
Customization and Extension
This project provides a foundation for an intelligent waste classification system, but you can customize and extend it further according to your requirements. Some possible enhancements include:

Training the deep learning model on additional waste classification data to improve accuracy.
Integrating a database or cloud storage system to store the waste classification results for future analysis or reporting.
Implementing a web-based user interface to monitor and control the system remotely.
Developing a mobile application for easy access and management of the waste classification system.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while setting up or running the intelligent waste classification system, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

Verify that all hardware connections are properly established and secure.
Check the software dependencies and versions, ensuring they are compatible with the project requirements.
Inspect the console output for any error messages or warnings that may indicate the cause of the problem.
Seek help from the project's documentation or online forums to find solutions to common issues.
